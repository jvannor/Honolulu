This project demonstrates connecting a simple sensor running on an embedded platform to an iOS App running on an Apple iDevice (iPhone, iPad).

Here, the embedded platform is an Adafruit Feather with Bluetooth capabilities (Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express) running Arduino firmware, connected to a time-of-flight distance sensor.

The project is called WODOMeter because the basic idea is to use the device as an accompaniment to your **W**orkout **o**f the **D**ay - you can use it to measure performance in terms of push-up depth, squat depth, or similar.  The app on the device is designed to broadcast these measurements to an app on the iOS device, where the data can be easily viewed.
